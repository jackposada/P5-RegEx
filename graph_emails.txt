 Richard

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S
 was supposed to go to). Aside from loss of life, this is a major blow to Pakistan. I recommend that you call Qureshi,

 Nawaz and Pasha (who will be here tomorrow). This will either break Pakistanis or will get them into the fight. This
shrine is deeply tied to the foundation of Islam in Pakistan.

FYI we are putting out the following statement.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON

Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore

I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of
Syed Ali Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis.

The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani

society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to
intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence.

We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend

their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
the victims and with all the people of Pakistan.

Re: UK politics/economy


1.    UK polls show support for the Lib-Dems after the launch of the draconian Cameron government budget cratering.
LD support is down to 16 percent, half what it was at its peak during the election and half of LD members now express a

desire to defect from their party. They feel deceived by LD ministers' participation in a Tory budget opposed to their
own beliefs. In Parliament, a secret caucus of LDs is meeting with Labour about opposing the budget. Meanwhile, short

term support for Cameron is static and for the government slightly up, but only translated to the Tories. Both the Tories
and Labour are up, profiting from the LD quandary. The scenario is potentially portentous for the LD Party: There was

once an influential Australian Liberal Democratic Party, holding 11 percent of the vote and the balance of power in the
Australian Senate. Upon reaching its zenith in 1996 the ALDP supported a Liberal (that is to say, a conservative)

government's budget and suffered collapse. Today the ALDP holds 1 percent of the seats in the lower House. The
 political effect of the conservative budget will almost certainly lead to an implosion of the Tory-LD coalition. In the short

 run it's possible the Tories will emerge having the greatest plurality of support. But if their budget does not produce
 prosperity they will pay the price, too. See Stiglitz's analysis below on the Tory budget with cold analysis of the US

 predicament.
 2.   The implications for US-UK cooperation are apparent. While there are spheres that remain, they are contingent,

 including the Afghanistan War, opposed by 75 percent of UK public and about which Cameron felt compelled this week

 to declare UK engagement would end in five years (that is, before the next UK election). On economic policy, the UK is
 no partner and no bridge to Europe, where the Merkel government has entered a fugue state of vertigo (another

       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015

subject). At no other time since World War II have the US and UK governments been at such odds over international

economics. With JFK and Macmillan, Macmillan accepted the postwar Keynesian consensus. Reagan and Thatcher, of
course, were of one mind ideologically, and the international economy was buoyed by Reagan's hyper-Keynesianism

masked as Thatcherism. Unfortunately, Obama did not reach out to Brown, who sought to reestablish the special

relationship around international economic recovery. Speaking of laissez faire, Cameron must be let alone to receive the
consequences (within 18 months) of his ideologically driven economics. Can he be engaged on international

development? Or does his budget rule that out too? There's not much there.
3.	   The Labour Party leadership contest is heating up. David Miliband has an article out today on how the Cameron

budget will foster "a lost generation." More on that soon...

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politicsksbornes-first-budget-its-wrong-wrong-wrong-2011501.html

Osborne's first Budget? It's wrong, wrong, wrong!
Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prizewinner who predicted the global crisis, delivers his verdict on the Chancellor's first Budget

and tells Paul Vallely it will take the UK deeper into recession and hit millions — the poorest — badly Sunday, 27 June 2010
George Osborne will probably not be very bothered that there is a man who thinks he got last week's emergency Budget

almost entirely wrong. But he should be. Because that man is a former chief economist at the World Bank who won the
Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on why markets do not produce the outcomes which, in theory, they ought to.

Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who has been described as the biggest brain in economics, is distinctly unimpressed by George
Osborne's strategy. This, he predicts, will make Britain's recovery from recession longer, slower and harder than it needs

to be. The rise in VAT could even tip us into a double-dip recession.
Stiglitz, who was once Bill Clinton's senior economic adviser, is now professor of economics and finance at Columbia

Business School. He was in the UK this week at the University of Manchester, where he chairs the Brooks World Poverty
Institute, but he lifted his head from the detail of international development to scrutinise the economic strategy of the

Conservative Chancellor whose Liberal Democrat partners recently reversed their judgement that massive public
spending cuts now would endanger the economy and joined in the Tory slash-and-burn strategy. They were deeply

wrong to do so, he believes.
 It would be a mistake to ignore Stiglitz on this. He has a track record of getting his predictions right. He was one of the

few economists who predicted the global financial meltdown long before it occurred.
"What happened was very much in accord with what I expected," he tells me when we meet for a coffee outside the

 Blackwell bookshop in the centre of the university. "The data was pretty clear about that." And the scale of the crash?
 "That wasn't a surprise," he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. "The bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst.

 "The thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities.
 They were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money," he says. Banks were

 demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. But "all this
 talk about innovation was a sham" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says.

 "There was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to
 take excessive risk. But there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at

 that level of stupidity. I predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems
 that were being created." His Nobel prize was given for exactly that — showing how markets fail because different people

 in them hold different levels of information.
 Yet there is no hint of I-told-you-so about Stiglitz's tone as he asks the waiter for coffee. He orders decaffeinated, but

 suggests the British economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the "fiscal consolidation" which is George
 Osborne's economic euphemism for cuts.

 Fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. World leaders embarked on that strategy — injecting money to re-energise the
 economy — after the banking crash three years ago. It was widely perceived not to have worked because the money

 governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their
 mortgages.

 "The problem was that, in the US, the stimulus wasn't big enough," he says. "Too much of it was in tax cuts. And when
 they gave money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored — we can

 expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year — and the economy has not been

       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015

restarted." Instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that

the government can do anything, Stiglitz says.
The result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on Greece and then Spain, everybody is now in a mood

of retrenchment. "It's not just pre-Keynesian, it's Hooverite," he says. By which he means governments are not just

refusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as Herbert Hoover did in the US in 1929 — when he turned the Wall Street
Crash into the Great Depression. "Hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he

decided to go for cuts — which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now
want."

It has become the new received wisdom throughout Europe. But it is the classic error made by those who confuse a
household's economics with those of a national economy.

"If you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts.
But in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the

amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up — and you don't have
enough money to pay your debts.

"The old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. We have lots of experiments which show
this, thanks to Herbert Hoover and the IMF," he adds. The IMF imposed that mistaken policy in Korea, Thailand,

Indonesia, Argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. "So we know what will happen:
economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. How far down we don't know

— it could be a Japanese malaise. Japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised VAT
and went into another recession."

Then why have we not learned from all that? Because politicians like George Osborne are driven by ideology; the
national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. Because the financial market

only cares about one thing — getting repaid. And because other European governments are panicking because of the
market's wild attack on Greece and Spain, and they don't want to be next.

"But cutbacks in Germany, Britain and France will mean all of Europe will suffer. The cuts will all feed back negatively.
And if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise

taxes more. It's a vicious downward spiral. We're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a
double dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. The best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. If

any one of these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real
problems. This is really risky, really scary."

So what should we be doing? "The lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. You cut out the war
in Afghanistan. You cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. You cut out oil subsidies.

There's a long list of things we can cut. But you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development,
infrastructure, education" — areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. "I

haven't done the calculation for Britain, but, for the US, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per
cent and the long-term deficit debt is lowered."

Taxes also need to be restructured. Osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent.
"There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent.

There's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. But you lower the tax
on investment in things like R&D."

Stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. Governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to
 businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. "If the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending

facility to do that job," he says. "In the US, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a
 new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed."

 Indeed, it could be done for far less. "Take $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and
that's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity — more than the real economy needs."

Such a move would help ordinary people more than all Osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. Stiglitz is sceptical,
 too, about the moral underpinning of a Budget which claims that "we are all in this together", but then hits the poorest

 hardest.
 Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Chancellor's Budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of

 their income, while the rich will lose just 1 per cent. "I've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in
 public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor," Stiglitz says. Osborne's Budget "may be well-

       UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777221 Date: 08/31/2015

intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that

magnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately".
His big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second.

"Developing countries have redirected themselves towards Asia, and China in particular, in recent years, so growth in
Africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn," he says.

Even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. "If aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected," he says. "China is
providing aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the US and Europe is mainly in education and health -

areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts."

Joseph Stiglitz has come full circle. What the world needs now — developing and developed — is not retrenchment but
greater economic stimulus. It is not a message many are in the mood to hear. But they didn't listen to him last time,

either. And he turned out to be right, and they were wrong — and at what a cost to us all.

Subject: Dear Madam Secretary, Thank you


Madam Secretary:

If you don't know my personal news yet (and I assume that you might through either Huma or Philippe), then here it is: I

Let me say first and foremost: I hope you don't see this as me leaving you or your team. I have asked the question many
times to Philippe and Huma about how you would take this news and the answer has always been the same - that you

would be happy for me - and I truly do hope that this is the case. The truth is that I applied while working in PA/PL and
was eventually wait listed and usually when wait listed you are not given the option to defer. That is neither here nor

there, but Philippe and Huma have both been incredible mentors to me throughout this entire decision-making process,
and for this, I am most grateful to them both.

The decision was not an easy one. First, Madam Secretary, you know when we first met: Believe it or not, it has been

over ten years now, 	                                                               You have not only been a role model and a
 mentor for me throughout the years, but I have watched you behind closed doors; out in public; and quite frankly, I have

watched you both win and lose. And whether winning or losing, you are courageous: no matter what, you are
determined and inspirational.

 I have seen many people join your team, leave your team, some work for a few years, others for many - and everyone

says they will still be "part of the family." Some seem to remain in touch; others don't. I see myself as a little different;
 maybe you don't. Both you and President Clinton have watched me grow since I was young. More than anything, I truly

 hope to remain a "part of the family."

 Sometimes people ask me why I have been dedicated to working for you for so many years. It is not for fame or glory.
 The truth is, I have worked for you  	                        because I have always believed in you. You are one of a kind -

 there is no other one like you, and there never will be. I truly believe that the world needs you in whatever capacity that
 you are in. And more than anything, I am most appreciative and thankful for all that you have offered me: Not only the

 mentorship and guidance but the continuous opportunities to learn. On my own path of public service, I can truly say
 that I was able to learn time and time again from the very best.

 Parting from your team is thus not an easy task for me, especially leaving Philippe's direct team, where I really enjoy

 what I am doing. But I also feel that I want to take another next step forward/a different one in my own life. And I am
 hopeful that this is not a permanent goodbye in any way. I hope that you and I can remain in touch via email, and I

 promise not to email too often, as I know how busy you are.

      UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05777063 Date: 08/31/2015

But I must reiterate one comment that I made: I have worked for you for so long for a reason: Not for my resume. Not
for myself, But because of you. I am confident enough to say that I know you well enough to tell others that I have

worked for the most brilliant mind and strongest leader I will ever see in my lifetime. And I am incredibly proud of that.

With eternal thanks and appreciation, of which cannot be summed up in words, let alone in an email,

My best, always,
David H.

  A PALI PAPA..PONYET PREVAL GONFLE

   Preval rejects US advice on presidential election

   By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) — 2 hours ago

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on holding an election

   for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered country without a credible
   leader.

   A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
   Committee, "strongly encourages" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member Provisional

   Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
   The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President Jean-

   Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute over rival
   candidate lists.

   On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree setting
   election day for Nov. 28.

   But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a day
   later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election body, known

   as the CEP.
   "I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners," Preval said. "The senator's

   proposition is inadmissible."
   Seeking to show the council was not "hand-picked," as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of nomination letters

   for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including the National Council of
   Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian Vodou.

    UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775309 Date: 08/31/2015

He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party in last year's elections, a ban that came

after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
"International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi

Lavalas," Preval said. "We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it out (for
themselves)."
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay or

opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party ahead of
planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated the
capital.

He also declined to answer questions about another U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report that criticizes
Haiti's earthquake recovery, saying he would address that issue at a news conference on reconstruction next week.
Elections have never been easy in Haiti, a country whose founding president crowned himself emperor. It took 186 years

to hold what the international community considered a democratic election in 1990, which was then closely followed by
a coup d'etat.
Preval, in fact, is the only Haitian ever to be elected president, serve a full term and hand off power to an elected

successor. Unable to run for re-election in the November contest, he pledged to relinquish power again as he did in the
1990s — after protesters alleged earlier this year that he was dragging his feet on holding presidential the election.
Doing so will require significant help. The electoral council's headquarters were destroyed and its records lost in the

quake, while millions of voters were either killed, made homeless or displaced. Its new headquarters is a former Gold's
Gym seized by drug agents.
The election will also be a cost burden for this grindingly poor Caribbean nation: $29 million according to electoral

officials at the news conference with Preval, $38 million according to the U.S. Senate report.
The Organization of American States and United Nations have pledged support. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon

issued a statement Wednesday praising the decree setting the election date and pledged the help of U.N. peacekeepers
and advisers in preparing and supporting the ballot. Ban urged member states to quickly provide the money needed to
run the vote.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security

Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security

Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone

call.

Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

      Scott Horton has just returned from a week in Kyrgyzstan, where he held lengthy private

      conversations with a range of leaders. He has sent me his confidential report. In light of
      the crisis there—the pogroms that have created perhaps as many as 450,000 refugees,
      according to the U.N.—and on the eve of the June 27 constitutional referendum—he
      explains. why and how this is an opportunity for joint U.S.-Russian action and other U.S.
      initiatives. His policy recommendations follow his report.

      Date: June 17, 2010

      Subj: Developments in Kyrgyzstan

      I was in Kyrgyzstan from June 1– 6, during which time I met with almost all the
      members of the interim government, with special focus on foreign relations, security and
      legal issues. Here are major points that emerged from my visit:

      1.  Crisis in the South. Although I departed before the pogroms had commenced in Osh,
      I found that the interim government fully expected violence to break out there but did not

      anticipate the inter-ethnic element. Several candidly acknowledged that the
       government's grip on the south, particularly Osh and Djalalabad provinces, was
       extremely tenuous. They said they had severe "loyalty" problems with key figures in the
       police and military. When I pressed on what they meant by "loyalty," I was told that the
       Bakiyev family had "its people" in key positions in the police and army and that they had

       intercepted communications between Janysh Bakiyev and a number of key security
       officers in the south. "Something is being planned to disrupt the referendum," I was told.
       Beknazarov told me he believed that, following the pattern of the last two revolutions,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015

      they anticipated that there would be an attack on administrative offices in the south,

      following quickly within a few days by attacks in Bishkek. Government leaders I spoke
      with over the weekend told me they now recognize they had misassessed the data they
      had, that the Bakiyev plan was obviously to instigate inter-ethnic violence.

      Precisely what led to the tragedy in and around Osh is still unclear and requires careful
      investigation, but people I have spoken with in Osh describe police and army leaders

      directing the pogroms, and they were able to identify some of these individuals as
      persons close to the Bakiyevs. Moreover, the timing and some of the specific
      descriptions of events support this thesis—Bakiyev was the only person who clearly had
      something to gain from the violence. If that is so, then Bakiyev adopted an extremely
      cynical, indeed criminal strategy. His objectives would have been to derail the

      referendum, demonstrate the weakness of the interim government, and fuel calls for an
      iron-fisted central government through the resurrection of his presidency. The tactics
      used bear comparison with those used by Slobodan Milosevia and Radovan Karathle as
      Yugoslavia disintegrated or by the Soviet MVD in the waning days of the Soviet empire
      in programs like "Operation Koltso." If the government's charges bear out, serious
      crimes were committed by the Bakiyev faction.

      While Otunbayeva publicly states that order has been restored in the south and that
      foreign intervention is no longer needed, I am not persuaded that this is what she actually
      thinks. She is anxious to build public confidence in her government and its abilities.
      Confidentially she acknowledges that the interim government's grip over the situation in
      the south is extremely weak and that the government does not feel it can necessarily
      count on the local police and military there, whose loyalties are plainly divided. This in

      turn suggests that the international community should give active consideration to both
      the humanitarian and the security dimensions of the situation in the south. My sense
      remains that Otunbayeva would strongly welcome such an initiative.

      2. Internal Workings of the Interim Government.         The interim government verges on
      being completely dysfunctional. It operates as a collection of individual fiefdoms, with
      leaders engaged in constant squabbles over patronage appointments. Career civil service

      personnel report being terrorized and extorted. I spent the better part of three days inside
      the current government headquarters on Staraya Ploshchod and was able to directly
      observe primitive horse-trading, threats and counterthreats between key government
      functionaries, sometimes in agitated voices. Roza Otunbayeva and a handful of figures
      closest to her were exceptions in this process—admonishing others about the
      unseemliness of their conduct, urging moderation and   .restraint. But Otunbayeva also

      acknowledges that the limitations on her own authority and states that she "has to put up
      with it," at least for the moment. Three government members advised me during
      meetings of their intention to resign before the end of the month in order to start running
      for parliament. Significantly, I sense sharp rifts within the government—between
      Atembayev and Beknazarov, for instance, who could not refrain from criticizing one
      another in my interviews with them, or between Sariyev and Beknazarov.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015

      Only Otunbayeva (and to a lesser extent her close ally Elmira Ibraimova) appear to be the
      glue that holds things together, commanding the respect of the other government
      members. I found that the admiration for Otunbayeva was almost universal—she appears
      to be the only figure in the government emerging from the interim period with an

      untarnished reputation. Still the special order under which she has assumed power as
      "president of the interim government" presents some clear problems for her authority.
      She has a fixed term into 2011, but she will have no democratic mandate. After the new
      government is formed, based on the parliamentary elections, they will have democratic
      legitimacy and she will not—this sets up a situation in which her authority may well be
      eclipsed or at least made more narrow. Still, all the members of the current government

      recognize that she has essential skills that they do not—particularly her ability to
      conciliate and her ability to reach out to other leaders on the international stage.

      There is an expectation that the parliamentary elections will result in a weeding out of the
      government. The next government is expected to be formed through a parliamentary
      coalition. But only two or perhaps three of the current seven factions will survive. Much

      of the bickering and instability in the current government is keyed to the coming game of
      parliamentary moving chairs—there is an intense struggle now to secure personal loyalty
      and funds to use in the parliamentary elections; the entire process has an aura of sink or
      swim about it. Ironically the immediate prospect of parliamentary elections and the sense
      that they will be genuinely open and fair thus contributes to the ineptness and near
      chaotic appearance of the current government.

      3. Constitution and Referendum.       Under the guidance of Tekebayev, the government
      put forward a proposed new constitution, which it seeks to have confirmed through a
      referendum vote on June 27. The constitution itself does shift the country further in the
      direction of a parliamentary democracy, and it contains unusual protection for
      parliamentary minority factions. Government leaders told me that Kazakh president

      Nursultan Nazarbayev had waded in on the question of the constitution directly, pressing
      them to retain a "strong president" system. They say this was coupled with not-very-
      subtle threats, and that the frontier between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan remains closed,
      with harmful consequences for the Kyrgyz economy. A major question exists about
      holding the referendum as scheduled. The events in the south have resulted in the mass
      displacement of population and if held as planned, a large part of the population in the

      south would probably be disenfranchised. However, government leaders say that their
      current problems all come back to legitimacy, and they will not be able to form a
      government with democratic legitimacy without a new constitution and new elections.
       Accordingly, they resist any further delays and are even contemplating moving the date
      of the parliamentary election forward to the last week of August (it is now set for October
      10). The crisis in the south presents a severe dilemma in this regards,  and it seems that

      this would have been Bakiyev's objective in instigating it, if indeed he did.

       4. Manas Transit Center.     As expected, I discovered that the interim government is
       deeply fragmented on the question of MTC. One faction headed by Otunbayeva favors a
      "pragmatic solution" to the base issue under which it will be continued but placed on a
       more transparent basis in which the economic benefits to the government are clear.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015

      Otunbayeva argues that the base can only be accepted under circumstances in which it
      presents no friction for Kyrgyz-Russian relations; she seeks to have disputes surrounding
      fuel supply, for instance, resolved directly between the United States and Russia.
      Another faction, headed by Beknazarov, takes a more demagogic approach, denouncing
      the base and seeking its closing in internal meetings. Talking with Beknazarov, I had the

      clear impression that his attitudes were entirely opportunistic—he thinks this will be a
      good campaign issue to use on the hustings. He suggested rather strongly that he could
      accept a continued base presence under the right circumstances and that he views threats
      to close the base as a sort of stick to use to extort more money and other concessions
      from the Americans. In general, Beknazarov strikes me as hot-headed and crass and an

      untrustworthy partner in any future discussions. Atembayev also has somewhat
      demagogic impulses, though they are mild by comparison. Otunbayeva, the third and
      most senior member of the government engaged on base issues, is the critical voice of
      reason in the process. My impression based on discussions with numerous figures is that
      Otunbayeva's views currently hold sway. However, all the government members are
      agreed that the economic deal struck by Bakiyev is unfavorable to the Kyrgyz state and

      that the base must rest on transparent economic concessions and there can be no more
      under-the-table dealings with political figures.

      5. Resolving the Crisis in the South. I    believe that two key points should be kept in
      mind when approaching the humanitarian crisis that has emerged in the south.      First,the
      crisis probably has its origins in a raw struggle for power. The interim government's

      legitimacy deficit contributed to the problem, because it left the government with weak
      tools to control the situation in the south. A long-term solution to the problem must
      involve the creation of governments at the national (Bishkek) and regional (Osh,
      Djalalabad) levels that have an essential modicum of democratic legitimacy. Delaying
      this process may only hasten the entire country's continued descent into chaos. This
      highlights the need to conduct free, fair and open elections as quickly as possible.

      Second, the last thing the interim government needs is a "Sophie's choice" between the
      United States and Russian Federation. International assistance needs to reflect a joint
      U.S.-Russian approach and showcase U.S. and Russian leadership (not merely
      participation). With President Medvedev's visit to the White House now on the horizon,
      this would be a good opportunity to establish joint sponsorship of an international
      humanitarian initiative. Here, I believe, are the essential elements of a program that

      could achieve U.S.-Russian co-sponsorship:

              An Appeal for Restraint:    Although the instigation of the conflict appears clearly
      to rest with ethnic Kyrgyz agitators, including a number in uniform and operating
      military equipment, at present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed groups are involved in
      random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted

      (rapes etc.) by another. Credible reports are suggesting that there has been political
      manipulation (including payment of money to drug and other criminal gangs) aimed at
      fomenting violence. The attack on a sports facility set up by a prominent Uzbek drug
      baron (murdered several years earlier) in Osh shortly before the violence started also
      suggests that criminal gangs involved in drug transshipment had another motivation for
      engaging in the violence. It may be that the violence was an initiative of the deposed

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015

      president, but once it began, it provided cover for numerous incidents of score-settling
      and criminal mischief. In these circumstances, a strong appeal for restraint is appropriate
      and martial law rules including curfews may legitimately be imposed by the interim
      government. An imprimatur of support from the international community would help

      establish the authority of the interim government in this process.

      •       Exit Corridors for Civilians: Civilians who feel threatened must be allowed to
      leave the high risk zones, and access of humanitarian aid, and creation of a safe zone for
      humanitarian operation should be priorities at locations created to shelter them. The EU,
      OSCE and UN issued a statement on June 16 calling for a humanitarian corridor in the

      southern regions of Osh and Jalalabad provinces, as well as of ensuring the equitable
      distribution of humanitarian aid among those in need. The cooperation of the Uzbek
      government may be particularly important in this process.

      •       Peacekeeping/Policing Operation: The international community should support

      special arrangements with broad international legitimacy and participation to enhance
      peacekeeping and police operations in the affected area. As I noted, even though
      Otunbayeva made a public statement on June 15 to the effect that foreign military/police
      intervention was no longer needed, the situation remains precarious and in her
      confidential discussions Otunbayeva acknowledges the benefits in confidence building
      that would emerge from an qualified, professional and international presence in the

      region. Peacekeeping/policing operations should at a minimum include security for
      designated sheltering areas for refugees and internally displaced persons and monitoring
      operations in tandem with local police and military, to build confidence in their protective
      functions.

      •       Investigation of Events:   a broad, credible, independent investigation should be
      undertaken into the events and their origin. The investigation should be under the aegis

      of an international organization, such as the Security Council or OSCE and it should be
      conducted by an individual of stature with strong credentials as a fact-finder and
       prosecutor. The investigation should particularly take cognizance of accusations that
       crimes against humanity were perpetrated, potentially including crimes of genocide. The
       involvement of persons exercising ostensible government authority—policemen, military

       figures, leaders of the civil administration—should be given special scrutiny in this
       process. The person commissioned to handle the investigation should be specifically
       empowered to recommend criminal charges be brought against individuals identified in
       his investigation—either by the criminal authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic or before an
       international body seized of proper jurisdiction.

               Effective Post -Conflict Reconstruction. UN authorities are estimating that as
       many as 450,000 persons may have been displaced by the current violence. The
       devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near total. There
       will be an intense housing shortage and a crisis with respect to food supply and
       healthcare. The international community under United States and Russian leadership
       should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process, prioritizing its

       assistance to benefit those most egregiously injured by the violence.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776492 Date: 08/31/2015

    •       The Referendum/Parliamentary Elections.          In view of the disruption and
     violence, the interim government may well conclude that the constitutional referendum
     must be postponed. However, if it does not postpone the referendum, then extraordinary

     measures should be taken.to insure that internally displaced persons and refugees are
     given an opportunity to vote—in both cases this will be a reemphasis of the bond of
     citizenship and a promise of inclusion in the democratic process that will be critical to the
     resolution of the crisis. The international community should also mobilize observers in
     connection with the parliamentary elections to help assure that candidates have fair

     access to the ballot and to media, that campaigns are permitted to proceed without
     unreasonable limitations and that voting occurs in a fair and free manner across the
     country. Special attention in this process should be given to the affected areas to insure
     that refugees and IDPs have a fair opportunity to vote and are freed from unreasonable
     limitations in the process.
